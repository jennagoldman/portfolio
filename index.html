          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <img src="img/jenna_headshot.jpg" alt="headshot of Jenna">
          <p>I am a front-end web developer based in the Pacific Northwest. As a kid growing up in Florida, I convinced my parents not to send me to summer camp in exchange for doing something productive with my time: learning HTML. What began as a mild curiosity quickly grew to become a personal passion that I have carried with me ever sense.</p>

          <p>I've supplemented my initial learnings over the years with front-end development courses to learn CSS, HTML5, and Bootstrap, and I have several years of professional work experience in bringing beautiful websites to life from mockups for brands such as The New York Times, Fast Company, Atlassian, Lexus, and Vogue.</p>

          <p>I am now focusing in on JavaScript and beyond in order to bring more functionality and interactivity to my skillset.</p>

          <p>When I'm not working, you can probably find me playing video games, baking sweets, or reading sci-fi.</p>
